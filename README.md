# python-web-checkers
Simple little checkers game made for my finals :)

Requires [Python 3.12 or newer](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [PyGame 2.6 or newer](https://www.pygame.org/).

Big thanks to [Tech With Tim](https://www.techwithtim.net/tutorials/python-online-game-tutorial) for putting out such a good networking tutorial! Without it, I don't know whether I could finish this little project of mine!

If no text is showing up... you might not be on *Windows or Linux*, if that happens please replace the font I used in the `client.py` for the one you desire!

To play, you just need to change the parameters of the `networkaddress.py` to your desired **IP Address** and **Port** *(note playing over the web requires Port Forwarding on your router's end)*. The server and clients must have **the same addresses** set, otherwise the game will not launch!
