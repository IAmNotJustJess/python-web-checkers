# python-web-checkers
Simple little checkers game made for my finals :)

Requires [Python 3.12 or newer](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [PyGame 2.6 or newer](https://www.pygame.org/).

Big thanks to [Tech With Tim](https://www.techwithtim.net/tutorials/python-online-game-tutorial) for putting out such a good networking tutorial! Without it, I don't know whether I could finish this little project of mine!
